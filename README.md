- 👋 Hi, I’m @FosRob
- 👀 I’m interested in coding & obtaining a job position in software development one day...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end, java, rust, c++ & python... I don't know what I like most yet.
- 💞️ I’m am willing to participate in open-source, once I have enough experience coding...
- 😋 Hopefully one day I can work for Microsoft, Amazon for a long term stable job position. That would be nice..
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am new to coding, but some friends say I am stuck in tutorial hell since 2019... I don't think I am ready.
